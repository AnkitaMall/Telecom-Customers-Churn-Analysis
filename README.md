# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for telecom companies. This project focuses on **predicting and analyzing customer churn** using data analytics techniques. By identifying high-risk customers and key churn factors, businesses can take proactive steps to improve retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and service usage.  
- Identify major **risk factors** leading to churn.  
- Segment customers into **tenure groups** and **monthly charge bins**.  
- Build KPIs such as **Churn Rate, High-Risk Customers, and Lifetime Value**.  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** in Tableau for visualization.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes telecom customer details such as:
- Customer ID  
- Tenure  
- Monthly Charges  
- Payment Method  
- Internet Service  
- Contract Type  
- Churn (Yes/No)  

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering & Risk Factors
- **Tenure Groups**: Customers with lower tenure showed higher churn probability.  
- **Monthly Charges Bins**: High-paying customers were more likely to churn if on short contracts.  
- **Payment Method**: Customers using electronic checks churned more compared to those using auto-pay/credit card.  
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn risk.  
- **Internet Service**: Fiber-optic users churned more than DSL users.  

---

## 📊 KPIs
- **Churned Customers** → Total number of customers who churned.  
- **Churn Rate** → `(Churned Customers / Total Customers) * 100`.  
- **High-Risk Segment** → Top 10 customers by churn probability based on risk factors.  

---

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** → SQL 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → SQL  
- **Dashboard Visualization** → Tableau  
- **Version Control** → GitHub  

---

## 📈 Dashboard (Tableau) Highlights
- **Overall Churn Rate & Total Customers**  
- **Churn Breakdown by Tenure, Monthly Charges, Contract, Internet Service**  
- **Interactive Filters** for customer segmentation  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Customers with **short tenure (< 12 months)** and **high monthly charges** are most at risk.  
- **Month-to-Month contracts** and **Electronic Check payments** significantly increase churn probability.  
- **Long-term contracts (1-year or 2-year)** with auto-payment methods reduce churn.  
- Fiber-optic users have a higher churn rate compared to DSL users.  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
By identifying high-risk customers and churn patterns, telecom companies can **develop targeted retention strategies**, such as offering discounts for long-term contracts, encouraging auto-pay enrollment, and providing better support for fiber-optic users.
